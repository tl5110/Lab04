 * 1. The toys are read into the file into a list of active toys.
 * 2. The toys are played with a random amount of time.  While
 *      active each one gets put on the back of the active toy list.
 *      When they retire after reaching maximum happiness, they
 *      move to a list of retired toys.
 * 3. Some statistics are displayed about the running of the simulation
